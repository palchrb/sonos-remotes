# sonos-remotes
(almost) screen-less rfid / button based Sonos remotes for my kids

App.py is the server, which uses Soco python library to control the sonos devices in my network.

I have made 3 different devices; two rfid remotes based on M5Stack iot-devices: M5Stick C plus 2, and their rfid 2 reader, and an M5 atom S3 lite with their rfid 2 reader. FInal remote i made was an Ikea Styrbar zigbee based remote for my 4 year old.
